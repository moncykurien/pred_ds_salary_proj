Starting with Reverend Cooper who began our journey in 1908, the hard work of thousands of physicians, employees, board members, and other volunteers brought Presbyterian from a tiny tuberculosis sanatorium to a statewide healthcare system, serving more than 700,000 New Mexicans.

We are part of New Mexico's history - and committed to its future. That is why we will continue to work just as hard and care just as deeply to serve New Mexico for years to come.

About New Mexico

Cities in New Mexico are continually ranked among the nation's best places to work and live by Forbes magazine, Kiplinger's Personal Finance, and other corporate and government relocation managers like Worldwide ERC.

We listen to employee feedback as we plan when and how we will return to the office in the future. While we can't have some of our favorite in-office perks (plenty of snacks, onsite gym, and bike storage), we've continued to find ways to stay true to SPINS:
Virtual yoga, HIIT, and Kinstretch classes each week
Each employee is allotted 8 hours to use to volunteer with an organization of their choice.
Stay connected with other SPINS employees for a weekly PELOTON ride together

About LogRocket

LogRocket was founded in 2016 by Matthew Arbesfeld and Ben Edelstein, a computer science duo who have been building products together since the third grade. Frustrated by how difficult it was to understand their customers' experiences, Arbesfeld and Edelstein set out toward an audacious goal: to make every experience on the web as perfect as possible.

Our team is a diverse group that brings an eclectic set of experiences from Google, Meteor, Drift, HubSpot, MIT, and Columbia. We enjoy eating lunch together every day in our airy downtown Boston office, learning more about each other at our show-and-tell sessions, and hosting our friends during #logrocketeer events. We focus on building our software with care and craftsmanship — our engineering blog posts offer a taste of that — and we welcome talented people from all backgrounds. Many of us have important spaces in our lives, whether it be family, social organizations, schools, or former companies, and we're doing all we can to make LogRocket another one.

Data science, predictive models, and statistics are second nature. You excel in building machine learning systems, conducting foolproof analyses, and leading cross functional projects. While banks are busy evaluating 30-year-old FICO scores, created before a time of the internet and smartphones, you’re building models which will decide who to lend to in real-time. Instead of hiring hundreds of people to manually review, you’re adding new data points to ensure accurate scoring. You’re hands-on, creative, and hyper-analytical. You understand that the ultimate measurement of success is enabling patients to afford care in a time of need, with a fair rate, in terms they understand. At the end of the day, you want to change the way credit is evaluated.

Background
Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.
But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.
At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.
Our Company & Culture
We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win. We take a humble approach to changing the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.
Anyone joining our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.
Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody.",4.3,"Brightidea

Background
Helping large companies innovate isn’t easy, but it is vital. Vital to creating new jobs, vital to igniting growth, vital to ensuring a safe, healthy and prosperous future for billions around the globe.
But, innovation at large companies is a mess. Employees often have lots of ideas to improve the business, but, with no formal process, their ideas go unheard, and they eventually give up trying to make a difference. Corporate innovation teams are expected to support a growing list of activities but have historically lacked strong tools designed for the job. Executives, despite having millions to invest, live in fear of disruption, and still have no idea where their “next big idea” will come from, or if it will come at all.
At Brightidea, we’ve built a software platform that’s solving these problems. We’ve been helping organizations be more efficient with the 1.5 trillion dollars invested in R&D annually.
Our Company & Culture
We are a tight-knit, entrepreneurial minded team of self-starters who show up every day with a singular mission: to create a world where the best ideas win. Our primary focus this year is to continue to add exceptionally talented and motivated individuals to the Brightidea team. We are ambitious, bold, highly-collaborative, focused, and we aim to win. We take a humble approach to changing the way corporate R&D teams run innovation challenges.
Anyone joining our company will have the opportunity to shape the culture and be an integral part of setting it up for long term success. If you identify with being humble, T-shaped, and relentlessly resourceful then this could be the perfect team for you to shine in.
Brightidea believes that everyone has the ability to make a difference and that a diverse team generates more innovation and bigger ideas. Just as our product invites organizations to crowd source innovation across their workforce, Brightidea is inclusive and does not discriminate. We accept everybody.",4.3,"Brightidea

"Data Scientist, Product",-1,"About the Role
We are looking for a Data Scientist to join our Data and Insights team. In this role, you will define metrics used to track engagement, feature usage, and user-centric outcomes. You will use data to uncover user preferences and quantify product experiences, all with an aim of guiding our Search and Recommendations team to build more relevant and impactful experiences for our users.
All of this means balancing ad hoc data exploration and longer-running analytical projects; designing and conducting experiments; bridging the gap between Product Managers and Data Engineers to assure that the necessary data is accessible and easy to use; regularly presenting findings to the Data and Insights team, Search and Recommendations team, as well as the company.
Skills we're looking for
Data manipulation
In our opinion, things that can be reasonably expressed in SQL, ought to be. We expect our Data Scientists to have strong analytical SQL skills. This means a fluidity constructing statements that rely on a combination of joins, aggregate functions, subqueries, and window functions. This role will work with large-scale data, so this person must have experience writing efficient, performance-optimized queries.
Analysis
Right now, our bias is toward models that can be interpreted to drive human action. We're seeking an individual who enjoys experimentation and statistical analysis—someone who can translate what they see in the data into useful policy suggestions. A thorough understanding of statistical inference is required.
Modeling
You should have hands-on experience building machine learning models (supervised and unsupervised) and know how to incorporate your models into production workflows and product experiences. At the outset, this role will largely focus on experimentation and more foundational product analysis; however, some degree of specialization in either preference learning and recommendations or text processing and search is expected.
Tooling expectations
Regular usage of a programming language typically used for statistical analysis and machine learning (ideally Python).
Strong experience with analytical SQL (ideally BigQuery, Snowflake, or a similar MPP data-warehouse technology).
Hands-on experience with self-service product-analytics tools (e.g., Looker, Mixpanel, Amplitude, Heap).
Training in statistics, econometrics, or machine learning, with plenty of real-world experience applying these methodologies.
Exposure to data sets used by Product teams. Chiefly, large-scale event data (e.g., Mixpanel, Segment, Snowplow, server logs) and normalized transactional databases (e.g., e-commerce and subscription datasets).
Additional comments
There are no specific degree requirements for this role: we appreciate and seek out diverse backgrounds. Instead of any particular formal education requirement, we'll flesh out what you've built, what you know, and how you approach problem solving.
As a company that serves musicians and producers, some knowledge of the music-production process is an asset. If this topic is new to you, that's okay—you should be open to learning about it.

ABOUT

We believe every human on the planet should have the option of free access to the world’s information and content. In many cases this belief is powered by a three way value exchange between a publisher producing free content, a consumer consuming it and an advertiser paying the publisher for the chance to connect with its audience. The underpinning of this value exchange relies on having an independent auditing, measurement and optimization layer to power the transaction between the advertiser and publisher.

Today the industry standard tools for advertising and media measurement and optimization are usually designed where increased personalization, higher advertising return on investment and increased publisher revenues often comes with negative trade off for consumer privacy or security risks of leaking private data. We envision a world where this doesn't have to be the case - a world where consumer privacy, security, and governance are incorporated into the fabric of the codebase while enabling the necessary business use-cases to effectively keep the world’s information and content free for everyone.

VideoAmp’s mission is to create software and data solutions to enable advertisers to accurately measure and optimize their entire portfolio of linear TV, OTT, digital and walled garden investments while empowering publishers to effectively align and monetize their audiences with the advertiser’s desired outcome in a consumer-first privacy paradigm.

About Us VIDEO
Founded in 2013, Pivotal Software, Inc. combines our leading cloud-native platform, tools, and methodology to empower the world's largest organizations to adapt to change and build great software. Our technology unleashes developer productivity, while fulfilling our mission to transform how the world builds software.
You
As a data scientist on Pivotal's Data Science team, you'll be working on a wide variety of data problems for a diverse range of clients. You will often be asked to learn new technologies and domains on the fly. You should be comfortable working under deadlines and making tough decisions. Consequently, you will frequently have to balance achieving an immediate goal with scalability and productionalizability.
The role offers room for personal and professional growth, and you won't be working in isolation. Data Science at Pivotal is an encouraging and supportive team, where ideas and challenges are addressed collaboratively. We're looking for the kind of person who will try and solve a problem on their own first, but isn't afraid to ask for help or say ""I don't know.""
Us
The Data Science team at Pivotal is primarily a consulting practice; we are tool agnostic, working with our customers to solve real world problems. Our customers, like us, are cross-disciplinary. We service engagements with use cases running from customer churn to optimization to detecting fraud and misconduct. We are not just doers, we are also educators and enablers.
Your Day
While there is no such thing as a ""typical day"", these are activities we frequently find ourselves doing:
Working with clients to uncover and frame new opportunities for data science. Clients often come to us without a clear understanding of what we can do, so this is our chance to open their eyes to new possibilities for their businesses.
Exploring client datasets, looking for actionable insights we can present.
Engineering features, training models, tuning hyperparameters and evaluating the results. We emphasize rigor, because data science done right at this stage leads to models that shine in production.
Taking the models we build into production. This is an exciting stage for anyone who likes collaborating with engineering teams and seeing their model become real when users interact with it.
Helping our clients develop their internal data science practices, from hiring and recruiting to data capturing, so that they can be successful when we hand off the project.
Required Skills / Experiences
Clear and empathetic communicator. You'll be the one sharing your insights with clients and stakeholders at check-ins, documenting your work, and even explaining your model to client data teams as part of a handoff. As such, communication and empathy are essential parts of your toolkit.
Advanced knowledge of statistical modeling and/or machine learning methods. These are the tools we need to go from analysis to prediction.
Strong programming skills. Left to our own devices most of us work in Python, but learning the client's tech stack is an important part of the job.
Strong exploratory data analysis skills. Every engagement starts with an investigation of the data, and thorough EDA saves us a lot of headaches in the long run.
Some travel is expected, depending on location and skillset. We mostly work out of the Pivotal office closest to the client, but sometimes we have to be on site for an extended period of time.
At least a bachelor's degree in an analytical or technical field. This could be applied mathematics, statistics, computer science, operations research, economics, etc. Higher education welcome and encouraged.
This role will support US government clients that require US citizenship. Given this, US citizenship is required for you to apply.
Desired Skills / Experiences
2+ years of work in a data-centric field (data science or data engineering).
Experience with relational databases.
Exposure and experience working in a Linux environment.
You have a specialization in an area like NLP, optimization, or image processing.
Hands-on experience working in a distributed computing environment or proven theoretical understanding of parallelism.
